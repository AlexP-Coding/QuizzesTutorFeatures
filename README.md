# Quizzes Tutor Features

This project consists of the addition of new features to the [Quizzes Tutor](QuizzesTutor.md) application.

It was originally a fork from https://github.com/tecnico-softeng-2022/es22-28 as per a class project. So the work done may be kept for posterity in case the original repository is deleted, I have created this repo for it.

## The Process

Work was done in a software development team of 6, according to Agile practices.

This team was split into subgroups of 2, each one responsible for one feature.

Feature implementation involved 3 stages:
1. Implementation of:
  - Domain-base code
  - Service tests
  - JPA (Spring) data access layers
2. Implementation of:
  - Service logic
  - Service tests
  - Spring-boot and web services
3. Concretization of:
  - Frontend (using Vue.js)
  - JMeter functionality tests
  - End-to-end tests
